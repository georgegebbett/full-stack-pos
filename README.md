#full-stack-pos

I am nearing the end of my freeCodeCamp qualification and will soon need to show people that I can build Things.

To this end I have decided to embark on building a simple point of sale system for a restaurant as a full stack single-page web app, using Node, React and Express.

Clearly I am some sort of lunatic for attempting this because I think so far it has aged me about 90 years.
